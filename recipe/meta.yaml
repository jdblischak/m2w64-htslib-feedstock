  description: |
    The conda binary m2w64-htslib bundles a pre-built htslib binary that was
    built under msys2. All dependencies are statically linked, with the
    exception of .DLLs provided by Windows. It is suitable for linking against
    in conda recipes that build using MSVC. It does not have libcurl support,
    so cannot be used with S3 or GCS.
